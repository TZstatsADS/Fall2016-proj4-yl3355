+ Projec title: Words for Music
+ Project summary: In this project, I use different methods to find a way predicting lyrics rank based on music features. I perform topic modeling on lyrics dataset of 2350 songs and 5000 words and cluster them into 20 topics. Then I extract music features of those songs and try to build bridges between lyrics and musics. Methods using are tuned XGBoost and Random Forest, and after comparing efficiency and accruacy rate, XGBoost combing with prior probability became my final choice.
